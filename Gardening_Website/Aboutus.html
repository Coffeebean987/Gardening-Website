<!-- About Us information-->
   
   <p id="para1">Our company started off with one man having one dream, to make gardening assecible to everyone at home. Located in 
       the rural part of Los Angeles, California, our company has been dedicated to researching new ways to grow and making
       it possible to grow for any income range. Gardening has always been a part of humanity ever since we started growing plants from seeds. Our founder believes
       that everyone should have a chance at gardening at home, whether growing from a huge garden or from a window in a studio apartment.
       Perhaps you may not even have room to grow next to a window, we have already thought of that!  
   </p>

   <p id="para1">We also specialize in the decorative and activity side of gardening. Whether it would be a nice decorative plant pot for your blueberry bush, a
       sculpted water fountain to look at while you relax on your locally sourced lounging chair, we have what it takes to enjoy the peaceful side of gardening.
       Our company believes that hard work, dedication, and care pays off while spending time with your plants. We believe in supporting local industry, since they as well
       have their own dreams. Most of the products you buy here were produced locally here or in the surrounding states in America. We say most ecause there are some items 
       that are not made here that we have to source outside of the United States. Do not worry, for as we make sure that these products are ethically produced from a reputable
        buissness.
